# Web3 Hackathon Project Outline: DeFi Yield Aggregator Platform

## 1. Project Overview

### Project Name
**YieldMax Protocol** - A decentralized yield farming aggregator that automatically optimizes returns across multiple DeFi protocols

### Tagline
"Maximize your DeFi yields with intelligent automation"

### Problem Statement
DeFi users face several challenges:
- Complexity in managing multiple protocols
- Time-intensive manual yield farming optimization
- High gas fees when moving funds frequently
- Difficulty tracking performance across platforms
- Impermanent loss risks

### Solution
YieldMax Protocol is an automated yield optimization platform that:
- Aggregates yields from multiple DeFi protocols (Compound, Aave, Yearn, etc.)
- Uses smart contracts to automatically reallocate funds to highest-yielding opportunities
- Provides single-click deployment with automated rebalancing
- Implements risk assessment algorithms
- Offers transparent fee structure and real-time analytics

## 2. Technical Architecture
